## Overview


This guide outlines how to accurately log time spent on emails, calls, and tasks in Zoho Desk. Keeping these records ensures transparency of support efforts and helps generate accurate reports.

In Zoho Desk, Call Activities and Task Activities represent primary actions taken on a ticket. For each of these primary activities, you can log one or more Time Entries—these are considered sub-activities that record how long each task or call actually took, including preparation and follow-up.


Example:

  - You create a **Call Activity** to record a conversation with a client.  
  - Then, you log a **Time Entry** under that call to capture 15 minutes spent summarising and following up.  
These time entries are critical for tracking actual work done and are used in reporting, unlike the default "Duration" field in the call activity itself.
