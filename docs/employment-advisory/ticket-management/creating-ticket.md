# Creating a Ticket

## Overview

This guide outlines how to create and manage support tickets in scenarios involving MSO (Multi-Site Organisation) accounts and their associated stores. Tickets may be raised either by MSO headquarters contacts or by store-level contacts.

## Terminology

- **Account:** Represents a company.
- **MSO Account:** The headquarters (e.g., Techinnovate)
- **MSO Store:** A child account under the MSO (e.g., Technoguys)
- **Contact:** A person associated with an account (e.g., Store Owner, Manager, Payroll Manager)

## Examples

- **MSO Head Office:** Techinnovate  
  **Contact:** David Lawson (Payroll Manager)

- **MSO Store (Child Account):** Technoguys  
  **Contact:** Amber Taylor (Store Owner)

## Creating a Ticket

There are two common scenarios when creating a ticket on behalf of a caller:

### Scenario 1: Caller submitting a ticket for their own account

Example: Amber Taylor (Technoguys) calls about an issue at Technoguys.

### Scenario 2: Caller submitting a ticket regarding a child account

Example: David Lawson (Techinnovate) calls about an issue at Technoguys.

### Steps to Create a Ticket

1. Click the search icon, type the callerâ€™s name, and select the relevant Contact.
2. Click **Add Ticket**.
3. Fill in the ticket form. Some information will be prefilled, such as the Contact Name and Account Name.
4. Complete the Category, Subject (required), and Description fields. Fill in additional fields as required.
5. **Scenario 2 only:** Select the Child Company in **Ticket Subject Company**. If the caller is reporting an issue about a child company (e.g., Head Office Contact reporting on a store), choose the appropriate child company in the Ticket Subject Company field.
6. **Scenario 1 only:** Leave **Ticket Subject Company** blank. If the issue is about the company the contact belongs to, do not select anything in this field.
7. Click **Submit**.
8. The ticket will now be created, and you may begin recording activities against it.
