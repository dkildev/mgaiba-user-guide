# Ticket Contact (Originator) Reassignment

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 10 July 2025

---

## Overview

When TMC (Call Centre) logs a ticket, the MGA Membership Engagement team is currently closing the TMC-created ticket and manually creating a new one using the correct contact from the original TMC ticket. However, it is not necessary to create a new ticket, as the contact on an existing ticket can be updated directly.

## Steps to Update a Contact

1. Open the ticket created by TMC and click **Edit Ticket**.

3. Confirm that the ticketâ€™s contact has been successfully updated. The ticket is now assigned to this contact, and you can communicate with them directly through the ticket or record any related correspondence within it.
