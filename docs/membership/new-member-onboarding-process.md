   - An email notification titled **"[Zoho CRM Lead] New Member Application Request"** is sent to the Membership Engagement Team.
   - A PDF copy of the submitted form is sent to **membership@mgaiba.org.au**.

3. A team member from the **Membership Engagement Team** logs into Zoho CRM and opens the **Leads** module.
   - Locate the new Lead (source: **Membership Application Form**).
   - Review the Lead details and attached PDF.

4. **Eligibility Verification**:
   - Verify the applicant via **Call** or **Email**.
     - Click **Send Email** to respond by email.
     - Click the **Phone** or **Mobile** number to initiate a call.

5. If the applicant qualifies:
   - Click the **Convert** button on the Lead record page.

   - **Important:** Before converting, manually create a Contact in the **Contacts** module by copying the details from the **Additional (Authorised) Business Contact** fields, as these are not automatically converted. After the Lead has been converted into an Account and Contact, update this Contact's **Account Name** field to reference the newly converted Account.
